# Description

# Setup

Ideally you have `pyenv` or some equivalent python version manager installed. This section will assume `pyenv`.

1. Install the local python version from `.python-version` and packages in `requirements.txt`. If you're using `pyenv` you can use the following make command

```
make install
```
